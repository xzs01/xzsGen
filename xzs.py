Not sure if a method like this has been posted before but i did search about. Anyways, contact dominoes head office

Say that you went to X store & ordered X pizzas for takeaway & once you got home & opened the box it was burned or use whatever excuse you feel comfortable with & wait for a reply. They should then email back saying they will pass the details on to the store that you mentioned going to. 

Then you will receive another email apologizing & offering you 2 free large pizzas or something similar. Print this off a take it to the store for your free pizzas, or better yet just phone your local dominoes & order them for delivery & hand the printed email to the driver.
